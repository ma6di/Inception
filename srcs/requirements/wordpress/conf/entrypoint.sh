#ping command here sends a ping request to MariaDB server.
#-h mariadb: connects to host named mariadb (usually a Docker service or hostname).
#-u "$DB_USER": connects with username stored in environment variable DB_USER.
#-p"$DB_PASSWORD": uses password stored in environment variable DB_PASSWORD.
#--silent: suppresses output unless there is an error.
#This returns success if MariaDB is accepting connections and responding.
#Logical AND operator: the next command is only executed if the previous command succeeds.
#So the next test is only run if mysqladmin ping succeeds.

### üìÑ Generate wp-config.php (if not already generated)
#wp-config.php is a core configuration file in WordPress. 
#It lives in the root directory of your WordPress installation
#It tells WordPress how to connect to the database (where all your website data lives).
#It contains important configuration settings that control WordPress behavior.
#Acts as the main bridge between your WordPress files and your database

  # üåç Add dynamic URL settings
  #They add two PHP constants to your wp-config.php file:
  #WP_HOME ‚Äî defines the home URL of your WordPress site (the public URL visitors type in to reach your site).
  #WP_SITEURL ‚Äî defines the WordPress installation URL, i.e., where WordPress core files are located.
  #By setting these constants, you explicitly tell WordPress:
  #"My site is hosted at https://your-domain.com" (assuming ${DOMAIN} holds your domain name).
  #WordPress will generate URLs for pages, assets, links, admin, etc., based on this domain.
  #WordPress uses HTTPS here because of https:// prefix, which ensures links use secure protocol.
  #Overrides the URLs stored in the WordPress database, which might be outdated or wrong 
  #(especially if you move your site or use Docker containers where URLs might change).  
  echo "define('WP_HOME', 'https://${DOMAIN}');" >> wp-config.php

mkdir -p /run/php
# Create the directory /run/php if it does not exist.
# The -p flag ensures that no error is thrown if the directory already exists.

chown www-data:www-data /run/php
# Change the ownership of the /run/php directory to the user 'www-data' and group 'www-data'.
# 'www-data' is typically the user that the web server (e.g., nginx or Apache) and PHP-FPM run under.
# This allows PHP-FPM and web server processes to have the necessary permissions to write to this directory.

exec php-fpm7.4 -F
# Replace the current shell process with the PHP-FPM process version 7.4.
# The -F option runs PHP-FPM in the foreground (no daemonizing).
# Running in foreground is essential for container environments (like Docker),
# so that the container stays alive as long as PHP-FPM is running.
